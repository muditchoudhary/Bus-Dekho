# About Bus Dekho

Bus Dekho is an application built for japurites and people who are new to Jaipur. The app helps the user to find a bus that is going where the user wants to go. For example, If person A wants to go from Jhotwara to Tonk Phatak, the app shows the bus which is going there along with the bus details. Like Fair, Routes via the bus travel and arrival frequency, etc.

# What's the inspiration? How do we get the idea?

Whenever we go to college by bus, we saw many people get on the bus and later after covering some distance realize that was the wrong bus and had to leave the bus and find the correct bus. This waste some of their and also the passengers on the bus. The problem people are facing is that they don't know which bus is going to their destination, before onboarding on the bus. So, this's the one reason we want to make an app around it. Another reason is that some bus conductors cheat passengers by not giving them proper ticker and get the money from them by giving some discount and don't provide the ticket. This leads to corruption. This is another reason we want 

# What were the problems and how we are solving them?

## 1. Helping people by showing the buses to their destination 
  #### How we are solving it?
    we are providing an app solution that lets the user provide the current and destination location where he/she wants to go. By providing the locations, the app shows the buses which go to that destination from the current location.

## 2. Heping people to get prevent ticket scams
  #### How are we solving it?
     Our app provides the necessary details of the bus including the fair char too which help the passenger to know how much the ticket price he/she should pay as per his/her kilometer journey.

# What's the current limitation of the app?
## - Manually typing the location. No auto-suggestion is provided by the app.
  Currently, the app does not provide a suggested location as soon as they start typing. This is a major User experience problem that way may try to fix.
## - Only Jaipur or local data has been provided?
  Currently, the app provides the details of buses that are running in Jaipur only.  

# What improvements could be made?
## - An auto-suggestion when typing could be implemented so that even if the user doesn't know the exact name of the place. The suggestions feature could help them.

## - The app would work for the other cities too in which city buses are used.

## - This app could calculate the fare for every type of passenger like Females, Males, kids, Students, etc. this feature could help them a lot
